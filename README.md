`redux-immutable` is used to create an equivalent function of Redux [`combineReducers`][combineReducers] that works with [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) state.

When Redux [`createStore`][createStore] `reducer` is created using `redux-immutable` then `initialState` must be an instance of [`Immutable.Iterable`][Iterable].

## Problem

When [`createStore`][createStore] is invoked with `initialState` that is an instance of `Immutable.Iterable` further invocation of reducer will [produce an error](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/v3.0.6/src/combineReducers.js#L31-L38):

> The initialState argument passed to createStore has unexpected type of "Object".
> Expected argument to be an object with the following keys: "data"

This is because Redux [`combineReducers`][combineReducers] [treats `state` object as a plain JavaScript object](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/v3.0.6/src/combineReducers.js#L120-L129).

`combineReducers` created using `redux-immutable` uses Immutable.js API to iterate the state.

## Usage

Create a store with `initialState` set to an instance of [`Immutable.Iterable`][Iterable]:

```js
import {
  combineReducers
} from 'redux-immutable';

import {
  createStore
} from 'redux';

const initialState = Immutable.Map();
const rootReducer = combineReducers({});
const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
```

### Using with `react-router-redux`

`react-router-redux` [`routeReducer`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/tree/v4.0.2#routerreducer) does not work with Immutable.js. You need to use a custom reducer:

```js
import Immutable from 'immutable';
import {
  LOCATION_CHANGE
} from 'react-router-redux';

const initialState = Immutable.fromJS({
  locationBeforeTransitions: null
});

export default (state = initialState, action) => {
  if (action.type === LOCATION_CHANGE) {
    return state.set('locationBeforeTransitions', action.payload);
  }

  return state;
};
```

Pass a selector to access the payload state and convert it to a JavaScript object via the [`selectLocationState` option on `syncHistoryWithStore`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/tree/v4.0.2#history--synchistorywithstorehistory-store-options):

```js
import {
  browserHistory
} from 'react-router';
import {
  syncHistoryWithStore
} from 'react-router-redux';

const history = syncHistoryWithStore(browserHistory, store, {
  selectLocationState (state) {
      return state.get('routing').toJS();
  }
});
```

The `'routing'` path depends on the `rootReducer` definition. This example assumes that `routeReducer` is made available under `routing` property of the `rootReducer`.
